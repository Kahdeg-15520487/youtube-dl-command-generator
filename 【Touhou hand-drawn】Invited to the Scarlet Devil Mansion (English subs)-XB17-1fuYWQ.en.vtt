00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Fuwaa--

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.680
--aaa. I'm so bored

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.680
(If there were an intruder, I could let loose with a danmaku battle...)

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.680
(Oops, I have to stay focused)

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.650
Sup!
Oh, hello, you two.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.810
Reimu-san, you're here at Ojousama's invitation, right?
Yes, that's right

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.510
And you, Marisa-san...
Well, I wasn't invited...

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.510
Then I can't let you through

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.510
Come on, don't make me sad

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.510
I could let you in if you will play with Imouto-sama

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.510
I came for Patchouli's books today
*crack crack*

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.510
I admire the honesty, but that's all the more reason to not let you through

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.250
So, what are you gonna do? That makes me an intruder

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.280
I will of course beat you back

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.810
I'm going in first

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.650
All right!

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.810
Invited to the Scarlet Devil Mansion

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.350
This is a derivative work

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.380
Welcome, we've been waiting for you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.210
I won't end my sentences with "--over."*
Who are you talking to?
[*Reference to Sf from Owari no Chronicle]

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.080
Your clothes look like they'd be annoying to draw
May I ask who you are talking to?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.310
This Mansion always makes me think of an organ

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.980
Thank you
It wasn't a compliment

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.110
click

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.810
Oh, it seems that a trap meant for intruders _malfunctioned_

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.650
I apologize. Are you all right, Reimu-san?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.150
I see, I guess it's fine if it's a malfunction
There won't be a second time

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.110
Hahaha!

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080
Aah? Where did you just look at before laughing?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.110
No, I'm glad you weren't hit

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.110
There you are, Reimu!
[Re-mi!]

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.110
Be thankful that you were invited to my tea!
From your soul!!

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.680
How annoying. I'm leaving
Oh, sorry! Come on, it was just a joke! A vampire joke

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.480
Since Ojousama is of excellent upbringing, she isn't good at honest communication

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480
Hey! Are you trying to say I don't understand social conventions?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
Not at all

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480
You've had a very admirable sheltered upbringing, Ojousama

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.480
You ARE making fun of me, aren't you?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.980
*punch*
I told you not to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.680
do stuff

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.910
that would give her a bad impression

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.580
Oh?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.080
There's no need to worry

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.950
Nothing could change

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.910
Reimu-san's impression of you NOW

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.680
How long is this skit going to last?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.150
I might actually leave, you know?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.150
Oh, don't leave!

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.280
So? Isn't it good?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.310
Sakuya made that cake

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.310
Mim im mimmy moom, Mamuma

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.480
Thank you for your kind words

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.810
Man, you understood that?

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.810
You must really not be used to eating sweets

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.980
Hm? ...Sakuya, did you do something different? It tastes better than usual

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.980
Yes, since we have a guest, I used an especially good water

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.150
BOSHUUUUU
It's water consecrated at Myouren Temple.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.350
SHUUU
*punch* *nom nom*
You know

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.710
That's really

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.680
quite a personality you got

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.180
Oh?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.280
Thank you very much

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.180
It wasn't a compliment

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.180
I apologize

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.850
Fugi!

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.610
CRAAACK

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.480
SNAP

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.510
grab grab

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.410
CLICK

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.180
FWOOSH

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.610
STOP

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.380
Gyaboo!
THUD

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.180
I see you're okay, Ojousama

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.010
Don't decide that without asking me

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.450
And Reimu-san, too

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.450
I'm glad you're all right
Tch!

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.450
VWIIIIIN

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.450
IIIIN
I don't think I need a knife for this cake

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.450
Hahaha

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.980
That's very funny

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.950
Meiling! I told you to be careful about stray bullets!

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.450
I'm sorry!

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.950
Can I beat you up now?

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.950
Why? That knife must be, you know, a stray.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.950
When did Meiling start throwing knives?

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:09.780
HUH? She doesn't. It's probably Marisa-san's new skill

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.780
Remilia, your servant is unbelievable. In the brain, I mean.
*nom nom* [The strawberry's so good]

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.010
Right?
*nom nom* [The strawberry's so good]

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.780
Thank you

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.150
It wasn't a compliment

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.950
Ug!

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.180
This stone statue brandishing a sword is the god?

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.950
That's right

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.950
Just a sword?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.950
How basic

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.980
He must be brave

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.450
To increase the population, this god even drops a thunder on the village

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.280
How selfish

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.310
It's faithful to the source material

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.280
[running]
Stop right there, Marisa!!
Reimu: Oh, you died
Remilia: Damn it

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.280
I'll give them back when I die! See ya!!
[Remilia: I'll increase the population]

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.280
Stop, damn it!!
[Remilia: Thunder, boom!]

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.280
CRAAASH

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.450
What is that?

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.450
Koakuma said she got it from that second-hand shop...umm

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.210
Kourindou?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.010
Yeah, that

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.180
She said "it might be useful for carrying baggage and books at the same time"
Koakuma: Are you okay?
Patchouli: Gunu...

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.010
By "baggage," I think she means Patchouli

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.980
Damn it, Marisa...

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.980
You say that, but you're actually happy to see her, aren't you?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.350
Oh, Reimu
[grin] [Hey, are you going to ignore me? Hello?]

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.780
Welcome
[grin] [Hey, are you going to ignore me? Hello?]

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.550
You have awful-looking eyes, as usual

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.080
Right back at you

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.080
Aren't you two being a bit too comfy? So lazy

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.080
Who cares? It's not like anyone's watching

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.080
So Meiling lost, huh. Are there punishments?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.080
Not really

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.110
There isn't?
[Ow...]

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.110
Meiling is something like a touchstone

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.110
If she accomplishes her duty as a gatekeeper, that's fine

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.110
Even if she lets someone through, if it's fun for me, that's also fine

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.480
I see

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.180
It's not fun for me!

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.980
Koa, Sakuya, Remi: Oh, come on

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.980
Giii!!!!

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.950
Damn it! You all keep making fun of me!

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.080
I'm leaving

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.110
Patchouli-sama, what shall I do with the cake?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.450
I'll eat it! Save me some!

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.450
It's about time I got going
Whaaa?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.510
You're already leaving?
I shall show you to the gate

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.280
Reimu-san

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.080
Thank you very much

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.110
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.350
Oneesama! Marisa's here!?
She already left

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:21.350
Since they met you two, Ojousama and Imouto-sama seem to be enjoying each day.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.680
*rub rub*
Whaaa? How come you didn't call meee?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.380
Sorry, Flan. So could you stop rubbing Oronain* all over my face?
[* A popular ointment brand]

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.450
And they smile more often now

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.450
Since their pride does not allow them to see their own transformation

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.380
I would like to thank you in their stead.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.980
But

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.610
please be sure

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.010
to not disappoint the Scarlet Devil.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.110
....

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.110
I'll keep that in mind.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.650
Well

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.650
It's just a way of saying, we look forward to our continued friendship.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.650
Oh, here's a gift. I put the cake inside

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.650
...thanks

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.550
Oh, Reimu-san. Sorry about earlier. Were you okay?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.550
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.450
I'm glad! Oh, you got a gift!

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.480
They gave me cake. I think I'll have it with Suika...
tic tic tic tic tic tic tic

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.480
tic tic tic tic tic

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.410
CRASH
There!
Whaaaaa

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.610
BOOOM!
Whaaaaaaaa

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.610
[smoke]
See you

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.910
[smoke]

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.950
Impressive as always. I think we'll be able to have a lot more fun, Ojousama

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.910
Sakuya

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.880
We need to talk

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.880
A raise? Thank you very much...

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.280
No, you idiot

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:14.480
Music

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.910
[hick-up]

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.910
Oh, Reimu, you're back~
Did you bring anything back~?

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.210
It exploded

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.180
That makes no sense~

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.210
Reimu, do you not like Sakuya?

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.880
Sakuya-san, do you not like Reimu-san?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.880
What makes you say that?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.910
Well, but SHE probably hates me.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.050
(They're birds of a feather, these two...)

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.610
The End
